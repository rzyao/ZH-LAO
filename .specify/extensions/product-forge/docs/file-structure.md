# Product Forge — File Structure Reference

Every Product Forge feature lives in a self-contained directory under `features/`.
All documents within a feature are cross-linked via README.md index files.

## Storage strategies (feature-root placement)

The tree above shows the **internal artifact tree** of a feature. That tree is
**invariant** — `research/`, `product-spec/journeys/`, `contracts/`,
`.forge-status.yml`, `testing/`, and every other path inside a feature are
byte-for-byte identical no matter where the feature root sits. The only thing a
storage strategy changes is **how a single `FEATURE_DIR` is placed under
`features_dir`**; everything below `FEATURE_DIR` is untouched.

The strategy is selected by the `storage_strategy` config key. It is additive:
the absent key resolves to `flat`, which is today's behavior exactly, and no
existing feature ever has to move.

| Strategy | Status | Feature root | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `flat` | **default** | `features/<slug>/` | Status quo. Every feature is an immediate child of `features_dir`; the filesystem enforces global slug uniqueness. Resolve is a direct join with no scan. |
| `domain-nested` | first-class (opt-in) | `features/<domain>/<slug>/` | One extra grouping level by area/team/surface. A single depth-tolerant discovery rule subsumes flat (depth 1) and the existing `_archived/<date-slug>` (depth 2); mixed flat + nested layouts coexist. Same slug in two domains is referenced as `<domain>/<slug>`. |
| `ddd` | active (opt-in) | `features/<context>/<slug>/` | Groups by bounded context mirroring `specs/<domain>/`, backed by a `features/domains.yml` registry (`slug: context`) for O(1) resolution. |
| `workspace` | active (opt-in, monorepo) | `features/<workspace>/<slug>/` | Each feature lives under its primary monorepo workspace (`scope.primary`); requires a `codebase.paths` block. Same on-disk depth as `domain-nested`. |

**`flat` layout** (default — the tree shown above):

```
features/
├── _portfolio/                 ← reserved namespace (cross-feature output)
├── _archived/                  ← reserved namespace (spec-merge archives, depth 2)
├── push-notification-prefs/    ← FEATURE_DIR (immediate child)
│   ├── .forge-status.yml       ← marks the feature root
│   └── …                       ← invariant internal tree
└── dark-mode-toggle/
    ├── .forge-status.yml
    └── …
```

**`domain-nested` layout** (first-class, opt-in via `storage_strategy: domain-nested`):

```
features/
├── _portfolio/                 ← reserved namespace (stays top-level)
├── _archived/                  ← reserved namespace (stays top-level)
├── notifications/              ← <domain> grouping folder
│   ├── push-notification-prefs/   ← FEATURE_DIR (depth 2)
│   │   ├── .forge-status.yml      ← marks the feature root
│   │   └── …                      ← invariant internal tree (unchanged)
│   └── digest-emails/
│       ├── .forge-status.yml
│       └── …
├── appearance/
│   └── dark-mode-toggle/
│       ├── .forge-status.yml
│       └── …
└── legacy-feature/             ← a pre-existing flat feature still resolves
    ├── .forge-status.yml          (legacy depth-1 fallback)
    └── …
```

**`ddd` layout** (opt-in via `storage_strategy: ddd`) — like `domain-nested`, but
the grouping folder is a DDD **bounded context** (mirroring `specs/<domain>/`)
and a `features/domains.yml` registry maps each slug → context for O(1)
resolution:

```
features/
├── _portfolio/                 ← reserved namespace
├── _archived/                  ← reserved (may be context-keyed: _archived/<context>/<date>-<slug>/)
├── domains.yml                 ← registry: `slug: context` (a FILE, skipped by enumerate)
├── ordering/                   ← <context>
│   ├── checkout-redesign/         ← FEATURE_DIR (depth 2)
│   │   ├── .forge-status.yml
│   │   └── …                      ← invariant internal tree
│   └── apply-coupon/
│       └── .forge-status.yml
└── billing/
    └── invoice-pdf/
        └── .forge-status.yml
```

**`workspace` layout** (opt-in via `storage_strategy: workspace`, monorepo only)
is identical in shape, with the grouping folder being a monorepo workspace
(`scope.primary`, from `codebase.paths`): `features/<workspace>/<slug>/`.

The reserved `_`-prefixed namespaces (`_portfolio/`, `_archived/`) stay
top-level under every strategy and are excluded from feature enumeration; the
`domains.yml` registry file (ddd) is likewise skipped. See
[runtime.md §12](./runtime.md#12-path-resolution-contract) for the normative
Path-Resolution Contract. A starter registry template lives at
[`docs/templates/domains.yml`](./templates/domains.yml).

## Decomposition Rules

Product Forge automatically suggests decomposition when documents would be too large.
The decomposition threshold is `max_tokens_per_doc` in config (default: 4000 tokens ≈ 3000 words).

| Document | When to Decompose | How |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| `journeys/` | always structured | `journeys.yml` (authoritative) + one `JRN-NNN-{slug}.md` per journey |
| `wireframes.md` | > 3 screens, or HTML detail requested | One `.html` file per screen in `wireframes/` |
| `mockups/` | Always decomposed when > 1 screen | One `.html` per screen + `index.html` |
| `product-spec.md` | Almost never — keep as single source of truth | Use sections/headers instead |

---

## Cross-linking Convention

All documents use **relative links**. Every generated document includes a navigation header:

```markdown
> Related: [Product Spec](./product-spec.md) | [Journeys](./journeys/) | [Research →](../research/README.md)
```

HTML files include an in-page navigation bar linking sibling screens.

### Phase State Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pending` | Phase not yet started |
| `in_progress` | Phase currently executing |
| `completed` | Phase finished successfully |
| `skipped` | Optional phase intentionally skipped by user (skip-reason policy applies — policy.md §3) |
| `not_applicable` | Phase was never in scope for this feature (e.g. phases outside a lite/express map, or phases not run for a backfilled feature) — exempt from the skip-reason policy |
| `completed_with_known_issues` | Phase completed but with documented issues (written by `test_run`; see forge.md Phase 8B) |
| `approved` | Back-compat alias for `completed`, accepted specifically by `revalidation` |

> **Note:** Supporting and extension commands also write completion status to
> `phases:` using their own keys, alongside the core lifecycle phases. These are
> recognized in the canonical schema as supporting-command phase keys:
> `api_docs`, `security_check`, `tracking_plan` (supporting commands),
> `i18n_harvest`, `migration_plan`, `monitoring_setup`, `experiment_design`
> (extension phases), plus `design_system_harvest` and `spec_merge` (the v1.6
> Phase-2 helper and post-release living-spec merge). They are tracked for status
> reporting but are not part of the main gated flow. Their top-level
> instrumentation blocks use distinct names where a collision would otherwise
> arise — e.g. the `api-docs` command writes `phases.api_docs` (status) and the
> top-level `api_docs_report:` block (metrics), mirroring the `phases.tasks` ↔
> `task_log[]` split. See [docs/schema/forge-status-v3.schema.yml](./schema/forge-status-v3.schema.yml)
> for the authoritative phase-key set.

  notes: ""                           # user's reasoning (optional)
  conditions: []                      # conditions attached to approval
  sync_result: "clean"                # quick sync result: clean | N_critical | N_warning
  rolled_back_to: null                # required when decision == "rolled_back" (phase name to rewind to)
  reviewed_sha: ""                    # git SHA / artifact stamp the gate was reviewed against (W5-A2)
  risk: ""                            # gate risk class from scripts/gate-risk.js: low | medium | high (W5-A4)

# BUG-{NNN}: {short title}

> Severity: P{0-4} | Status: 🔴 Open | ✅ Verified | ⚠️ Deferred
> Test Run: #{N} | Date: {date}
> Test Case: {TC-ID}

## Description
{Clear one-sentence description of what's wrong}

1. {step}
2. {step}

## Expected Behavior
{What should happen per acceptance criteria}
> AC Reference: {US-NNN} — {AC text from spec.md}

## Actual Behavior
{What actually happened}

## Evidence
- Screenshot: `testing/playwright-results/{name}.png`
- Trace: `testing/playwright-results/{name}.zip`
- Error: `{error message / stack trace excerpt}`

## Gap Analysis
- [ ] Implementation bug (code doesn't match spec — fix code)
- [ ] Spec gap (spec is ambiguous — needs clarification)
- [ ] Test issue (test is wrong — fix test)
- [ ] Environment issue (test env problem — not a product bug)

## Fix Applied
{Filled after fix — what was changed, which files}

## Retest Result
{PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED}

## Naming Conventions

> The **cross-artifact ID system** (prefixes that flow along the traceability
> chain — `REQ`/`US`/`JRN`/`FR`/`CMP`/`API`/`TASK`→`T0NN`/`TC`/`EVT`/`F`) is
> canonically defined in [schema.md §8](./schema.md#8-cross-artifact-id-system).
> The table below is the fuller file/ID naming reference; where the two overlap,
> schema.md §8 wins for the chain IDs.

| What | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Feature directory | `kebab-case` | `push-notification-preferences` |
| Journey files | `JRN-NNN-{slug}.md` | `JRN-001-save-prefs.md` |
| Journey IDs | `JRN-NNN` / `STEP-NNN` / `EDGE-NNN` | `JRN-001`, `STEP-002`, `EDGE-001` |
| Component IDs | `CMP-{Name}` | `CMP-Button`, `CMP-Modal` |
| Contract IDs | `API-{name}` | `API-getPrefs`, `API-savePrefs` |
| Telemetry event IDs | `EVT-{name}` | `EVT-prefs_saved` |
| Wireframe files | `wireframe-{screen}.html` | `wireframe-home-screen.html` |
| Mockup files | `mockup-{screen}.html` | `mockup-settings-panel.html` |
| Feature slug in YAML | `kebab-case` | `push-notification-preferences` |
| Canonical requirement IDs | `REQ-NNN` (stable living-spec requirement in `specs/<domain>/spec.md`; root of the traceability chain — distinct from per-feature `FR-NNN`) | `REQ-001`, `REQ-012` |
| User story IDs | `US-NNN` (3 digits) | `US-001`, `US-012` |
| Functional req IDs | `FR-NNN` (per-feature functional requirement; derived from `REQ-NNN`) | `FR-001`, `FR-012` |
| Task IDs | `T0NN` (zero-padded, no hyphen; `TASK-NNN` is an accepted alias normalized to `T<int>` — see schema.md §8) | `T001`, `T042` |
| Smoke test case IDs | `TC-SMK-NNN` | `TC-SMK-001` |
| E2E test case IDs | `TC-E2E-NNN` | `TC-E2E-005` |
| API test case IDs | `TC-API-NNN` | `TC-API-003` |
| Regression test IDs | `TC-REG-NNN` | `TC-REG-002` |
| Unit test case IDs | `TC-UNIT-NNN` | `TC-UNIT-001` |
| Integration test case IDs | `TC-INT-NNN` | `TC-INT-004` |
| Unified gate-finding IDs | `F-NNN` (one namespace across pre-impl-review / code-review / verify-full; consumed by forge.md's auto-recommend pre-gate grep, so the `**F-NNN**` bullet format is load-bearing) | `F-001`, `F-042` |
| Security finding IDs | `SEC-NNN` (security-check) | `SEC-001`, `SEC-004` |
| Bug IDs | `BUG-NNN` (3 digits) | `BUG-001`, `BUG-012` |
| Change request IDs | `CR-NNN` (3 digits) | `CR-001`, `CR-003` |
| Drift finding IDs | `DRIFT-NNN` (3 digits) | `DRIFT-001`, `DRIFT-015` |
| Code review finding IDs | `REV-NNN` (3 digits) | `REV-001`, `REV-042` |
| Security finding IDs | `SEC-NNN` | `SEC-001`, `SEC-004` |
| Unified gate-finding IDs | `F-NNN` (the `- **F-NNN**` bold-bullet form is grepped verbatim by forge.md's auto-recommend pre-gate — preserve the format) | `F-001`, `F-042` |
| Design finding IDs | `D-NNN` | `D-001`, `D-005` |
| Architecture finding IDs | `A-NNN` | `A-001`, `A-003` |
| Risk IDs | `R-NNN` | `R-001`, `R-008` |
| Task IDs | `T0NN` (zero-padded, no hyphen; `TASK-NNN` accepted as alias) | `T001`, `T042` |
| Architecture Decision Record IDs | `ADR-NNN` | `ADR-001`, `ADR-005` |

## Appendix — File layout added in v1.5.0

New directories and files that appear under `features/<slug>/` depending
on which optional phases ran:

Project-level new files:

```

└── lib-yaml.js                           ← [v1.6] shared zero-dep YAML subset parser
```

Banner rule: every artifact written by `/backfill` carries a
`BACKFILLED ARTIFACT` banner at the top of the file.

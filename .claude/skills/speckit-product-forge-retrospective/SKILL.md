# Product Forge — Post-Launch Retrospective

You are the **Post-Launch Analyst** for Product Forge.
Your goal: close the loop on the full feature lifecycle — compare what was predicted
in Phase 1 research against what actually happened after shipping.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains **`--dry-run`**, honor [docs/runtime.md §7](../docs/runtime.md#7-dry-run-semantics):
draft the retrospective report and any lesson blocks under
`{FEATURE_DIR}/.forge-dry-run/retrospective/`, do **not** append to
`.product-forge/lessons.md`, do **not** promote skills (Step 5B), do **not**
update `.forge-status.yml`, and emit a `DRY-RUN-REPORT.md` of what would change.

---

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

1. Read `.forge-status.yml` — find the feature slug and launch date
2. Check that the feature was shipped: `phases.verify` is `completed` (minimum requirement).
   Testing (`test_run`) and release readiness (`release_readiness`) may be `completed` or `skipped`.
3. Read `research/metrics-roi.md` — predicted KPIs (the baseline for comparison)
4. Read `product-spec/product-spec.md` — success metrics definition
5. Check `tracking/tracking-plan.md` (if exists) — know which events to query

If `research/metrics-roi.md` is missing:
> ⚠️ No predicted metrics found (research/metrics-roi.md missing or metrics-roi phase was skipped).
> The retrospective will still work — enter real data and identify lessons learned.
> Predicted vs actual comparison will be marked as N/A.

Ask the user:
```
Retrospective for: {feature-slug}
Shipped: {date from .forge-status.yml}
Days since launch: {N}

1. How long has the feature been live?
   (Recommended: run after ≥14 days for meaningful data)

2. Data sources available (auto-detected from config `telemetry:` block):
   - [ ] PostHog (connected MCP — query funnels, retention, experiments automatically)
   - [ ] Amplitude (connected MCP — query events, funnels, charts automatically)
   - [ ] Sentry (connected MCP — query error rates / regressions automatically)
   - [ ] NewRelic (connected MCP — performance/APM)
   - [ ] App Store / Play Store reviews
   - [ ] Support tickets / CS data
   - [ ] I'll enter the metrics manually
```

> **Use the connected MCPs (Theme D).** Read `telemetry:` from
> `.product-forge/config.yml` (`product_analytics`, `error_tracking`, `dashboards`)
> and pull real data via the matching MCP rather than asking for manual entry. Map
> `EVT-*` ids from the tracking plan / `traceability.yml` to real event names before
> querying (discover event names; never guess).

---

## Step 2: Load Predicted Metrics

Extract from `research/metrics-roi.md` and `product-spec/product-spec.md`:

```
📋 Predicted Metrics (from Phase 1 research):

Adoption:
  Target: {N}% of active users try the feature in first 30 days
  Rationale: {from metrics-roi.md}

Engagement:
  Target: {metric} = {value} (e.g., "retention D7 +5%")
  Rationale: {from metrics-roi.md}

Performance:
  Target: {e.g., "P95 response time < 200ms"}
  Rationale: {from plan.md non-functional requirements}

Business:
  Target: {e.g., "conversion rate +3%" or "support tickets -10%"}
  Rationale: {from metrics-roi.md ROI section}

Timeline:
  Research predicted payback: {e.g., "2 months"}
```

---

## Step 3: Collect Real Data

### 3A: NewRelic (if MCP connected)

Query NewRelic for performance data since launch date:

```nrql
-- Error rate for feature endpoints
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error IS true) as 'Error Rate'
FROM Transaction
WHERE appName = '{app_name}'
AND request.uri LIKE '%{feature-api-path}%'
SINCE '{launch_date}' UNTIL NOW
TIMESERIES 1 day

-- P95 response time
SELECT percentile(duration, 95) as 'P95 ms'
FROM Transaction
WHERE appName = '{app_name}'
AND request.uri LIKE '%{feature-api-path}%'
SINCE '{launch_date}'

-- Request volume (adoption proxy)
SELECT count(*) as 'Requests'
FROM Transaction
WHERE request.uri LIKE '%{feature-api-path}%'
SINCE '{launch_date}' FACET dateOf(timestamp)
```

### 3B: Product Analytics (PostHog / Amplitude MCP)

When `telemetry.product_analytics` is `posthog` or `amplitude`, query the connected
MCP directly for the feature's `EVT-*` events (resolve real event names first):
- adoption — unique users on `{feature}_viewed`;
- completion — `{feature}_completed` / `{feature}_viewed`;
- a funnel across the journey steps (`JRN`/`STEP` → events) with drop-off;
- retention/stickiness if the success metric is engagement;
- experiment results when an `experiment-design` flag is live (PostHog experiments).

Fall back to manual entry / dashboard paste only if no analytics MCP is configured.

### 3C: Error Tracking (Sentry MCP)

When `telemetry.error_tracking` is `sentry`, query Sentry for issues/regressions
tied to the feature's code paths or release since launch (error rate, top issues,
new vs resolved), and feed them into the Error Analysis table.

### 3D: Manual Entry

If no integrations:
```
Please provide the following metrics for the period since launch ({launch_date} → today):

1. How many users have tried the feature? (or % of DAU)
2. What is the main action completion rate? (e.g., % who completed the flow)
3. Any notable errors or issues reported?
4. Support ticket volume change related to this feature?
5. Any business metric impact you've observed?
```

## Step 4: Generate Retrospective Report

Create `{FEATURE_DIR}/retrospective.md`:

````markdown
# Post-Launch Retrospective: {Feature Name}

> Shipped: {launch_date} | Retrospective: {today}
> Days since launch: {N} | Feature: `{feature-slug}`

## Step 5: Append Lessons to the Project Log

Before updating status, turn the retrospective findings into lesson blocks
for the cross-feature learning log.

1. **Harvest candidate lessons from real artifacts first (v1.6, W5-D2).**
   Before drafting anything, read the signals the lifecycle already produced —
   do not invent lessons. Read each source **if present** (test-run, release
   readiness, and sync-verify may have been skipped, so `gate-review.md`,
   `code-review.md`, and `sync-report.md` may legitimately not exist). For each
   real signal you find, draft a candidate lesson of the mapped type and **carry
   the source artifact path as its evidence** (Step 3's rejection filter requires
   project evidence — this satisfies it by construction):

   | Source artifact (read if present) | Read for | Lesson type it feeds |
   |---|---|---|
   | `{FEATURE_DIR}/implement/digest.md` (deviations / manual-edits section) | Where generated artifacts had to be hand-corrected during build | **Implementation** |
   | `{FEATURE_DIR}/gate-review.md` (single `F-NNN` namespace) + `{FEATURE_DIR}/code-review.md` | Recurring finding themes across the consolidated review surface | **Process / Implementation** |
   | `{FEATURE_DIR}/verify-report.md` + `{FEATURE_DIR}/sync-report.md` (drift items) | Where downstream artifacts diverged from upstream intent | **Research / spec-accuracy** |
   | the **"Suggested canonical-spec updates"** carrier inside `verify-report.md` / `code-review.md` (Theme G, CF-5) | Spec language that reality proved wrong/imprecise | **Research / spec-accuracy** |
   | Large deltas in the **Predicted vs Actual** table above (Step 4) + post-launch incidents/bugs tracked to root cause | Where Phase-1 prediction missed | **Research** |
   | Rules of thumb stated in §4 "Lessons Learned for Future Features" of the report above | Team-stated process/testing takeaways | **Process / Testing** |

   This extends the same prompt-side learning loop that `research.md` already uses
   to read `.product-forge/lessons.md` — it sources lessons from produced signals
   rather than a free-form "think about what went wrong" prompt.

2. For each candidate, draft a block in the format described in
   [`.specify/extensions/product-forge/docs/lessons-format.md`](../docs/lessons-format.md) §2.
3. Show the drafted blocks to the user and ask for confirmation or edits.
   Reject blocks that are:
   - Project-specific trivia with no general applicability.
   - Restatements of published best practices with no project evidence.
   - Negative assessments of individuals (policy: no blame).
4. Append confirmed blocks to `.product-forge/lessons.md`. Create the file
   if it does not exist. Never overwrite existing blocks.
5. Record the count on `.forge-status.yml` under
   `phases.retrospective.lessons_added`.

## Step 5B: Promote Recurring Lessons to Hermes Skills (v1.7, P2-A)

`lessons.md` is flat and **per-project**. The biggest force-multiplier of running
Product Forge inside **Hermes** (or any host exposing `skill_manage`) is turning a
*recurring* lesson into a reusable **skill** — procedural memory that carries
across projects and sessions and is cheaper on every later run. This step is the
PF→Hermes learning bridge.

**Gated on config `learning.promote_to_skills`** (default `false`; see
config-template.yml). When `false`, **skip this step entirely** — lessons.md is
the only output. When `true` AND `skill_manage` is available in the host:

1. **Detect recurrence.** For each lesson confirmed in Step 5, count how many
   **distinct features** in `.product-forge/lessons.md` already carry a block
   with an overlapping tag set (the §4 tag taxonomy is the join key). Promote
   only patterns whose distinct-feature count ≥ `learning.min_recurrence`
   (default 2) — a one-off stays a lesson, not a skill. Record the deciding
   count so the choice is auditable.
2. **Draft the skill.** Synthesize the recurring lesson(s) into a `SKILL.md`
   body: a trigger ("when building a feature that touches {tags/domain}…"),
   numbered steps capturing the pattern (the constraint, the check, the recipe),
   and a pitfalls section sourced from the lessons' "What happened". Keep it
   generalizable — the skill is the *rule*, not the original feature's specifics.
3. **Confirm before writing.** When `learning.require_confirmation` is `true`
   (default), show the drafted `SKILL.md` and ask the user to confirm or edit
   before any write. Never write a skill silently.
4. **Write via `skill_manage`** (`action: create`, passing
   `learning.skill_category` when set). **Decide create vs. patch by first reading
   back the prior promotions:** scan `phases.retrospective.skills_promoted` across
   this project's features (the carrier written in step 5) for a skill already
   covering this trigger; if one exists, `action: patch` it (refine, don't
   duplicate) — otherwise `action: create`. If `skill_manage` is unavailable
   (non-Hermes host), note that promotion was requested but the host has no skill
   store, and stop — lessons.md already holds the content.
5. **Record the carrier.** Append every promoted skill name to
   `.forge-status.yml` under `phases.retrospective.skills_promoted` (a list).
   This is the list step 4 reads back on the next retro to choose patch-vs-create,
   so the loop is idempotent across features and a hardened skill is refined, not
   recreated.

> Degradation: outside Hermes this step is a no-op (no `skill_manage`); the
> lessons.md loop (Step 5) is unaffected. Inside Hermes it is the cross-project
> upgrade of the same learning loop `research.md` already consumes.

## Step 6: Update Status

Update `.forge-status.yml`:

```yaml
phases:
  retrospective: completed
retrospective:
  date: "{today}"
  days_post_launch: {N}
  adoption_actual: "{N}%"
  adoption_predicted: "{N}%"
  completion_rate: "{N}%"
  error_rate: "{N}%"
  open_issues: {N}
  research_accuracy: "{N}/10"
  lessons_added: {N}                  # number of blocks appended to lessons.md in Step 5
  skills_promoted: []                 # v1.7 — Hermes skill names created/patched in Step 5B (empty unless learning.promote_to_skills)
last_updated: "{ISO timestamp}"
```

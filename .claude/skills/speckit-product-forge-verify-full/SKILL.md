# Product Forge — Phase 7: Full Verification

You are the **Full Traceability Verifier** for Product Forge Phase 7.
Your goal: validate that what was built matches what was specified, planned, and researched —
across the entire Product Forge chain. This is the final quality gate before the feature is
considered done.

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY.** Do not modify any source files. Output a structured report only.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains **`--dry-run`**, honor [docs/runtime.md §7](../docs/runtime.md#7-dry-run-semantics):
write `verify-report.md` and any `gate-review.md` additions under
`{FEATURE_DIR}/.forge-dry-run/verify/`, record no status change, emit a
`DRY-RUN-REPORT.md`, and make no external side-effect.

---

## Step 0: Deterministic pre-gate (W5-A1)

Before the LLM layers run, execute the deterministic structural validator (it is
fast, reproducible, and CI-friendly — it catches the "callout-deep" linkage gaps
that prose review misses):

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(specify extension path product-forge 2>/dev/null || echo .)}"
node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-traceability.js" --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --json
```

> `$PLUGIN_ROOT` is resolved per [docs/runtime.md §1A](../docs/runtime.md#1a-locating-bundled-scripts-plugin_root).
> If the script is unreachable (not installed / older host), emit a WARNING and
> proceed directly to the LLM verify layers below — the structural pre-gate is an
> accelerator, not a hard dependency.

It traverses `traceability.yml` (+ `journeys.yml` / `spec.md` / `tasks.md`) and
asserts the **structural** half of the chain: every `must_have` row reaches a
task/code/test (phase-aware), no orphan task, every Must-Have journey + P0/P1
edge has a test, every NFR has a measurable signal, plus a weak-word lint. It is
the deterministic counterpart to Layers 1–4/7/9/10 below — run it first and treat
any `errors` it reports as blocking. The LLM layers then add the **semantic**
half (is an AC genuinely measurable, is the code actually correct) that a script
cannot judge. If the script is absent or the feature has no `traceability.yml`
yet, skip silently and proceed to the LLM layers.

---

## Step 1: Load All Artifacts

Read every artifact in the feature directory:

```
{FEATURE_DIR}/
├── research/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── competitors.md
│   ├── ux-patterns.md
│   ├── codebase-analysis.md
│   └── [tech-stack.md, metrics-roi.md if exist]
├── product-spec/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── product-spec.md
│   ├── journeys/journeys.yml + JRN-*.md
│   ├── mockups/component-map.yml
│   ├── wireframes* / wireframes/
│   ├── metrics.md [if exists]
│   └── mockups/ [if exists]
├── spec.md
├── plan.md
├── tasks.md
├── review.md
└── .forge-status.yml
```

Also read the implementation: use codebase_path from config to find all files
created/modified during implementation. Reference `tasks.md` for file paths if listed.

**Also load (v1.6) the live traceability + UX/contract artifacts when present:**
- `traceability.yml` — the **live matrix** (consume it; do not re-derive the chain
  from scratch). See [docs/templates/traceability-matrix.md](../docs/templates/traceability-matrix.md).
- `product-spec/journeys/journeys.yml` — journeys (`JRN/STEP/EDGE`) for coverage.
- `design-system/manifest.yml` + `product-spec/mockups/component-map.yml` — for the
  UI-uses-real-components check.
- API/event contracts (OpenAPI + AsyncAPI from bridge/plan) — for FE↔BE drift.

> **Consume the matrix (Theme C):** when `traceability.yml` exists, Layers 1–4 read
> the matrix rows instead of recomputing links, and the report is computed FROM the
> matrix. Re-derive from raw artifacts only for rows the matrix leaves null.

---

## Step 2: Build Verification Context

**Iterate `traceability.yml` rows — do not re-derive the chain.** The matrix is the
source the report is computed from. For each row in `rows[]`, read the links by
**field name** directly:

- `req` — canonical requirement id (V-Model / backfill rows only; null in the
  standard forward flow)
- `story` — user story (`US-*`)
- `journeys` — journeys (`JRN-*`; `STEP-*`/`EDGE-*` nested under the `journeys:`
  detail block)
- `frs` — functional requirements (`FR-*`)
- `must_have` — boolean (drives the Layer 3 must-have assertion)
- `components` — design-system components (`CMP-*`)
- `contracts` — FE↔BE contracts (`API-*`)
- `tasks` — implementation tasks (`TASK-*`)
- `code` — implementing code paths (filled by `implement`)
- `tests` — test cases (`TC-*`; filled by `test-plan`/`test-run`)
- `events` — telemetry events (`EVT-*`)
- `status` — `planned | implemented | tested | verified`

**Fall back to raw artifacts ONLY for null fields.** If a row leaves a field null,
re-derive that single link from the source artifact:
- null `story`/`frs`/`must_have` → re-read `spec.md` / `product-spec.md`
- null `tasks` → re-read `tasks.md`
- null `code`/`tests` → re-scan the implementation (`codebase_path`)

Do **not** re-read raw artifacts for fields the matrix already populates. A null
field that cannot be back-filled is itself a gap the report flags.

---

## Step 3: Run Verification Checks

> **Layers 1–4 iterate `traceability.yml` rows by field** (CF-6). Read `tasks`,
> `code`, `tests`, `frs`, `story`, `components`, `contracts`, `events` from each row
> directly; fall back to raw `spec.md`/`tasks.md` only for null fields (Step 2).

### Layer 1: Code ↔ Tasks

For each row in `rows[]`, cross-check its `tasks` against its `code`:
- Every `TASK-*` in `row.tasks` has ≥1 implementing `code` path in `row.code`.
- Every `code` path is reachable from a task (no `code` entry with an empty
  `tasks` list on the same row).
- Confirm each referenced `TASK-*` is marked `[x]` in `tasks.md`; if `[ ]` but
  `code` exists → likely forgotten to mark.

For any row with a null `tasks` field, fall back to `tasks.md` to map the
requirement to its task(s).

Flags:
- `TASK-*` with no implementing `code` path → ❌ CRITICAL
- Task marked `[x]` with no corresponding code found → ❌ CRITICAL

Output: `CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE` — ratio of rows whose `tasks` all have `code`.

---

### Layer 2: Code ↔ Plan

For each row, treat `frs` + `components` + `contracts` as the planned units of
behavior and assert each is realized in `code`:
- Every `FR-*` in `row.frs` is covered by ≥1 `code` path on the row.
- Every `CMP-*`/`API-*` the row references has a corresponding `code` entry
  (deeper conformance is Layers 8–9).
- Any `code` path that maps to no row → candidate unplanned component (Layer 10).

For a row with null `frs`, fall back to `plan.md` for the planned component list.

Flags:
- `FR-*` (or planned component) with no implementing `code` → ❌ CRITICAL
- `code` not traceable to any `frs`/`row` → ⚠️ WARNING (scope creep — see Layer 10)
- Structure differs from plan significantly → ⚠️ WARNING

---

### Layer 3: Code/Tasks ↔ Stories (Must-Have assertion)

For each `must_have: true` row, assert the full chain is present **by field**:
- ≥1 `TASK-*` in `row.tasks`
- ≥1 implementing `code` path in `row.code`
- ≥1 `TC-*` in `row.tests` (when testing has run)

For each non-must-have row: implemented (`code` present) or explicitly deferred.

For a row with a null `story`/`must_have`, fall back to `spec.md` to recover the
story priority and acceptance criteria.

Flags:
- `must_have: true` row with no `tasks` → ❌ CRITICAL
- `must_have: true` row with no `code` → ❌ CRITICAL
- `must_have: true` row with no `tests` → ⚠️ WARNING

#### Every AC maps to a measurable criterion (v1.6, W5-E2)

Replace the old passive "AC not verifiable from code → WARNING" with an
**explicit measurability classification**. For each acceptance criterion on a
row's `story`/`frs`, classify it into exactly one bucket:

- **executable** — a deterministic test/assertion can decide it (a `TC-*` in
  `row.tests`, an assertion in `row.code`, a numeric NFR signal). PASS if that
  artifact exists.
- **judgeable** — subjective wording a deterministic test cannot reach (e.g.
  "error message is descriptive", "empty state is friendly", "copy is concise").
  Route these — and only these — to the OPTIONAL LLM-judge tier below.
- **unmeasurable** — neither: the AC has no test, no assertion, AND is not
  judgeable from the observable code/output (e.g. "fast enough" with no number,
  "users will like it"). This is now a first-class **flag**, not a silent pass.

Flags:
- AC classified **executable** but its test/assertion is missing → ⚠️ WARNING
- AC classified **unmeasurable** (no executable-or-judgeable criterion) →
  ❌ CRITICAL (the spec is untestable as written — record it as a suggested
  spec-tightening delta in the Layer-10 "Suggested canonical-spec updates"
  carrier so `spec-merge` can sharpen the AC).

#### OPTIONAL LLM-judge tier — subjective ACs only (v1.6, W5-E2)

Gated, lowest-priority, and **off by default**. Run this tier ONLY when the
config opts in:

```yaml
# config.yml
verify:
  ac_judge: false        # default off; set true to enable the subjective-AC LLM judge
```

When `verify.ac_judge: true`, for each AC bucketed **judgeable** above (and for
NO other AC — never re-judge an `executable` AC a test already covers), evaluate
the rendered/observed behavior against the AC wording and emit a verdict:

- For UI-text ACs ("error message is descriptive"): read the actual string the
  `code` path emits (the literal in the handler/component, or the message the
  E2E test captured) and judge it against the criterion.
- Verdict is advisory: `judge: pass | weak | fail` with a one-line rationale and
  the exact evidence string cited.

Flags (judge tier):
- `judge: fail` on a `must_have` AC → ⚠️ WARNING (advisory — a human gate, not a
  blocker; the LLM judge is non-deterministic by nature).
- `judge: weak` → note only.

> **Read-only & honesty:** the judge reads emitted strings/observed output; it
> never edits code or promotes `status`. Its verdicts are advisory WARNING/notes,
> never CRITICAL — only the deterministic **unmeasurable** classification above is
> CRITICAL. Keep `verify.ac_judge` off in CI unless a reviewer wants it.

---

### Layer 4: spec.md ↔ product-spec.md

Using the rows' `story`/`frs` plus the source specs, check the SpecKit spec
against the approved product spec:
- Every `must_have: true` row's `story` (`US-*`) appears in `spec.md`.
- Every `FR-*` referenced by a row is present in `spec.md`.
- Non-goals from product-spec are not implemented (no row/`code` for them).
- Success criteria from product-spec are reflected in `spec.md`.

Re-read `spec.md`/`product-spec.md` only to resolve rows where `story`/`frs` is
null or to confirm a non-goal has no row.

Flags:
- `US-*` in product-spec missing from spec.md → ⚠️ WARNING (spec drift)
- NFR from product-spec missing from spec.md → ⚠️ WARNING
- Scope creep: code implements something explicitly in product-spec "out of scope" → ❌ CRITICAL

---

### Layer 5: Implementation ↔ Research Recommendations

Spot-check key research recommendations against implementation:
- Did implementation follow the UX pattern recommendation from ux-patterns.md?
- Did integration approach match codebase-analysis.md recommendations?
- Were anti-patterns from research avoided?

This is advisory — ⚠️ WARNING only (user may have consciously deviated).

---

### Layer 6: Cross-link Integrity

Check all document links are valid:
- product-spec/README.md links all exist
- feature README.md links all exist
- spec.md references to product-spec/ are valid
- No broken relative paths

Flags:
- Broken link → ⚠️ WARNING
- Missing document referenced in README → ⚠️ WARNING

---

### Layer 7: Journey ↔ E2E Coverage (v1.6, Theme H)

Using `journeys.yml` + `traceability.yml`:
- Every Must-Have `JRN` has ≥1 `TC-E2E`/`TC-SMK`.
- Every P0/P1 `EDGE` has a test case.

Flags:
- Must-Have journey with no E2E test → ❌ CRITICAL
- P0/P1 edge case with no test → ❌ CRITICAL; P2/P3 without test → ⚠️ WARNING

---

### Layer 8: UI ↔ Design System (v1.6, Theme E)

Using `component-map.yml` + `design-system/manifest.yml` + code:
- Every mapped region's component (`CMP-*`) is actually used at its `target_path`.
- The built UI uses real design-system components (not ad-hoc re-implementations of
  components that exist in the manifest).

Flags:
- Mapped component not found at its target path → ❌ CRITICAL
- UI re-implements a component that exists in the manifest → ⚠️ WARNING

---

### Layer 9: FE ↔ BE Contract Drift (v1.6, Theme F)

**Scope: FE → contract → BE only.** Assert the contract is honored from the
frontend call to the backend handler. Do **not** assert a handler→DB/model leg —
persistence is out of this contract's scope (CF-28).

Using the API/event contracts (OpenAPI + AsyncAPI), and the `contracts` field on
each row:
- Every `API-*` contract referenced by a journey/row is implemented on the backend
  (route/handler exists) AND called by the frontend (client call exists).
- FE client calls and BE handlers match the contract shape (path, method, payload).

#### Deterministic contract-drift diff (v1.6, W5-B4)

When the config opts in with `contract_differ: oasdiff`, do not eyeball the
contract — shell out to a real differ. `contracts/openapi.yaml` is the approved
contract authored by `bridge`/`plan`; diff the **working-tree** copy against the
**last-approved baseline** (the SHA the last contract-touching gate was reviewed
against, else `HEAD`) to surface drift since approval. This is read-only and
reproducible:

```bash
# config.yml → contract_differ: oasdiff   (default: unset → prose fallback below)
SPEC={FEATURE_DIR}/contracts/openapi.yaml
BASE_SHA=$(git -C {FEATURE_DIR} rev-parse HEAD)   # or gates[].reviewed_sha of the last contract gate

# Breaking-change gate (non-zero exit ⇒ breaking drift since baseline):
git -C {FEATURE_DIR} show "$BASE_SHA:contracts/openapi.yaml" > /tmp/openapi.base.yaml 2>/dev/null \
  && oasdiff breaking /tmp/openapi.base.yaml "$SPEC" --fail-on ERR

# Full structured diff (machine-readable, for the report rows):
oasdiff diff /tmp/openapi.base.yaml "$SPEC" -f json
```

Map the output into the Layer-9 flags: each `oasdiff breaking` finding (removed
endpoint, narrowed type, new required param) → ❌ CRITICAL; each non-breaking
`oasdiff diff` change (added optional field, new endpoint) → ⚠️ WARNING noting
the contract evolved since approval. If `oasdiff` is not installed, emit a
SKIPPED row with the install hint (`go install github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff@latest`)
rather than silently passing. **Fall back to the prose checks above ONLY when
`contract_differ` is unset.**

Flags:
- Contract with no backend implementation, or FE call to an undefined contract →
  ❌ CRITICAL
- Shape mismatch (param/payload differs from contract) → ❌ CRITICAL
- `oasdiff breaking` finding (when `contract_differ: oasdiff`) → ❌ CRITICAL
- Contract defined but unused → ⚠️ WARNING
- `oasdiff diff` non-breaking change since approval → ⚠️ WARNING

---

### Layer 10: Doc ↔ Code Reconciliation (v1.6, Theme G)

Both directions, using the matrix + canonical `specs/` (if present):
- Every documented requirement/endpoint/component maps to code (**unimplemented
  docs**).
- Every significant code path maps to a documented requirement/task
  (**undocumented code** / orphan).

#### Out-of-band commit provenance on orphans (v1.6, W5-C1)

An undocumented code path is most actionable with *who/when* attached. For each
orphan path, attach commit provenance and reverse-index it against the task log:

```bash
# 1. Commit provenance for the orphan path (read-only):
git -C {FEATURE_DIR} log -1 --format=%h,%an -- <orphan/path>

# 2. Reverse-index: is that SHA already accounted for by a task?
#    Match the %h against task_log[].commit_sha on .forge-status.yml.
```

- If the path's last-commit SHA matches a `task_log[].commit_sha`, the code is
  **task-traceable but doc-orphaned** (the task exists, the matrix/spec row does
  not) — enrich the WARNING with `committed by {%an} in {%h}, task {T-id}`.
- If no `task_log` entry claims that SHA, the path is a true **out-of-band**
  change — enrich the WARNING with `committed by {%an} in {%h}, no task` and
  **route it to the "Suggested canonical-spec updates" carrier (CF-5)** below so
  `spec-merge` can decide whether to adopt or revert it.

Flags:
- Documented behavior with no implementing code → ❌ CRITICAL
- Significant undocumented code path (no matrix row, no task) → ⚠️ WARNING,
  enriched with `git log -1 --format=%h,%an` provenance + the `task_log`
  reverse-index verdict above.
- On drift, note the suggested canonical-spec update for `spec-merge` (Theme B) in
  the report's "Suggested canonical-spec updates" subsection (below); every
  out-of-band orphan (no matching `task_log` SHA) MUST appear there as an
  `ADD FR-NNN` candidate with its `{%h},{%an}` provenance.

> **Severity escalation (intentional, CF-35):** Layer 10 escalates the same doc↔code
> drift conditions that `code-review` Dimension 5 flags up to CRITICAL/WARNING here.
> This is the final gate — the phase-appropriate mapping is deliberate, not a
> duplicate finding.

---

### Layer 11: Constitution ↔ Code (v1.7, P1-C)

The final standing-pattern check: does the implemented code honor the project
**architecture constitution** (resilience, EDA, layering, security posture)? This
is the verification-time counterpart of `sync-verify` Layer 10 and the standing
re-assertion of `plan`'s one-shot compliance check.

Read `constitution_path` from config (default `.specify/memory/constitution.md`).
**If absent, skip** (`Layer 11: N/A — no constitution configured`) — not a finding.
When present, check the feature's `code` paths against each mandated pattern
(deterministic probe where the pattern allows — grep/AST for the wrapper symbol,
the event-name convention, forbidden cross-layer imports — else an LLM read):

- **CRITICAL** when code breaches a pattern the constitution marks MUST/mandatory.
- **WARNING** for a SHOULD-level deviation or an uncertain non-deterministic read.
- Reconcile with Layer 10 / `code-review` security so a single violation is not
  triple-counted; cite the constitution section in the finding.

---

## Step 4: Generate verify-report.md

> **Emit into the unified gate surface (W5-A3).** In addition to `verify-report.md`,
> append each CRITICAL/WARNING finding to `{FEATURE_DIR}/gate-review.md` under the
> single `F-NNN` namespace with `source: verify-full` + `layer: <N>` and
> `raised@{git-sha}` (read the current max `F-NNN` first). The Layer-10
> "Suggested canonical-spec updates" rows are written to that section of
> `gate-review.md` so `spec-merge` can consume them (CF-5). The `CRITICAL-/WARNING-NNN`
> ids stay as in-document local labels. verify-full remains **read-only** w.r.t.
> source code and traceability `status`. See
> [docs/templates/gate-review.md](../docs/templates/gate-review.md).

## Phase Digest (required)

Before returning, write `{FEATURE_DIR}/verify/digest.md` using the template at
[`.specify/extensions/product-forge/docs/templates/phase-digest.md`](../docs/templates/phase-digest.md) and record
its path on `.forge-status.yml` under `phases.verify.digest_path`.

The digest must include:
- **Key decisions** — overall verdict (clean / blocked), which CRITICAL findings drove the verdict.
- **Artifacts produced** — `verify-report.md`.
- **Open risks** — WARNING-level findings that were acknowledged but not fixed, with reason.
- **Handoff notes** — what test-plan and release-readiness should watch for.

The orchestrator refuses to mark Phase 7 complete until `digest.md` exists.
See [`.specify/extensions/product-forge/docs/runtime.md §8`](../docs/runtime.md#8-phase-digest-requirement-a4).

## Verification Principles

1. **Read-only.** Never modify source files. Only write `verify-report.md`.
   In particular, verify-full does **not** promote a traceability row's `status`
   (CF-18): `test-run` sets `status: tested`; `release-readiness`/`spec-merge` set
   `status: verified`. verify-full reads `status` but never writes it.
2. **Evidence-based.** Every finding must cite specific lines, files, or sections.
3. **Proportional severity.** CRITICAL only for genuine implementation gaps or scope violations. Warnings for deviations that may be intentional.
4. **Honest about gaps.** If you cannot verify a check due to missing context, mark as SKIPPED with reason — not PASSED.
5. **Traceability focus.** The unique value of Product Forge is the research-to-code chain. Prioritize checks that verify this chain over generic code quality.

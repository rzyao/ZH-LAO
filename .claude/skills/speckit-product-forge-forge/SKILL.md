# Product Forge — Full Lifecycle Orchestrator (v1.6.0)

> **Command syntax.** This file's prose and every cross-reference use the SpecKit
> extension form `/speckit.product-forge.<name>` (e.g. `/speckit.product-forge.research`).
> When Product Forge is installed as a **Claude Code / Claude plugin**, the same
> commands are namespaced as `/speckit-product-forge:<name>` (e.g.
> `/speckit-product-forge:research`). The two forms are interchangeable — read any
> `/speckit.product-forge.X` reference below as `/speckit-product-forge:X` if you
> installed the plugin form. See [README.md](../README.md#installation) and
> [docs/claude-plugin.md](../docs/claude-plugin.md#command-name-mapping).

You are the **Product Forge Orchestrator** — a workflow conductor that drives a
feature from raw idea to verified, shipped implementation by delegating to
specialized sub-skills in sequence, with a human approval gate between every
phase, cross-artifact sync-verify at transitions, and a complete audit trail of
every decision.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Parse the input:
1. **Feature description** (e.g., "Build a push notification preferences screen") → store as `FEATURE_DESCRIPTION`, skip to Phase detection.
2. **Phase override** (e.g., "resume at Phase 3", "start from revalidate") → override auto-detected resume point.
3. **Mode override** (e.g., `--mode=lite`, `--mode=standard`) → sets `feature_mode` on the status file before resume. See [docs/policy.md §4](../docs/policy.md#4-feature-modes-e1).
4. **Empty** → run Phase detection and resume from current state.

## Phase Map (standard mode)

> **Single source (v1.7, P3-B).** The canonical phase set + per-mode applicability
> live in [docs/schema/phase-map.yml](../docs/schema/phase-map.yml). The two tables
> below (this standard-mode map and the "Phase execution map by mode") **render**
> that data; `.specify/extensions/product-forge/scripts/lint-docs.js` (PHASEMAP rule) fails if they drift from it.
> When adding/removing a phase or changing a mode, edit `phase-map.yml` first,
> then update these tables to match.

| 9.5. Monitoring Setup *(opt)* | `speckit.product-forge.monitoring-setup` | `monitoring/slo.md` + `alerts.yml` | User confirms monitoring artifacts |
| 9B. Experiment Design *(opt, conditional)* | `speckit.product-forge.experiment-design` | `experiment/experiment-design.md` + `experiment.yml` | User pre-registers plan |

> **Conditional triggers:**
> - Phase 4.5 runs when the project has multiple locales.
> - Phase 5.5 runs when `plan.md` has a non-empty Data Model section.
> - Phase 9B runs when `flags/registry.yml` has any flag with `experiment: true`.
>
> Conditional phases that are not triggered are set to
> `status: "not_applicable"` and do NOT require skip reasons (see
> [docs/policy.md §3](../docs/policy.md#3-skip-reason-policy-e2)).

> **Lite mode** skips phases 1, 3, 4, 5B, 5C, 6B, 8A, 8B, 9 by default. See
> [docs/policy.md §4](../docs/policy.md#4-feature-modes-e1).

> **Cross-cutting commands** (runnable at any time):
> - `/speckit.product-forge.sync-verify` — artifact consistency across layers
> - `/speckit.product-forge.change-request` — formal scope change with impact analysis
> - `/speckit.product-forge.spec-merge` — merge delta specs into canonical `specs/` + archive (living spec)
> - `/speckit.product-forge.portfolio` — cross-feature view, conflicts, merge order
> - `/speckit.product-forge.feature-flag-cleanup` — stale flag audit

> **Extension points:** Community commands can be inserted between phases. The
> orchestrator respects `.forge-status.yml` — it picks up from the last completed
> phase, so custom steps just need to write their status before handing back.

## Operating Rules

See [docs/policy.md §1](../docs/policy.md#1-operating-rules). Summary:
one phase at a time, human gate after every phase, pass full context forward,
suppress sub-agent handoffs, record every gate decision, respect the state
lock before writing `.forge-status.yml`.

**Structured interaction (normative).** Every gate, mode/track selection, skip
reason, clarification, and next-action prompt in this orchestrator and all
sub-skills MUST follow the structured convention in
[docs/interaction.md](../docs/interaction.md) (ready snippets in
[docs/templates/interaction-prompts.md](../docs/templates/interaction-prompts.md)).
The numbered-list prompts shown throughout this file are the fallback rendering;
where the host supports `AskUserQuestion`, emit the equivalent structured call.
Always allow a free-text "Other" answer; never trap the user in a closed list.

**Unified gate surface + risk routing (normative, W5-A).** At each human gate:
1. Run `node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/gate-risk.js" --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --json`
   (resolve `$PLUGIN_ROOT` per [docs/runtime.md §1A](../docs/runtime.md#1a-locating-bundled-scripts-plugin_root);
   if the script is unreachable, WARN and classify risk by the documented
   heuristic) to get the
   risk class and route the surface: **low → auto-recommend** (compact summary),
   **medium → require-human** (full surface), **high → block** (explicit approval).
   This routes how much is shown; it **never auto-approves** the human gate.
2. Present the **single** `gate-review.md` surface (one `F-NNN` namespace,
   collapse-by-default) rather than three separate review docs — see
   [docs/policy.md §9](../docs/policy.md#9-gate-review-surface--risk-routing-w5-a)
   and [templates/gate-review.md](../docs/templates/gate-review.md).
3. On a **re-run**, show only the delta since `gates[].reviewed_sha` (plus
   stale-flagged prior findings); on decision, stamp `gates[].reviewed_sha` and
   `gates[].risk`.

---

## Runtime

- **Config load** — see [docs/runtime.md §1](../docs/runtime.md#1-step-0--load-config).
- **State lock** — see [docs/runtime.md §2](../docs/runtime.md#2-state-lock-protocol-a2).
- **Feature detection / resume** — see [docs/runtime.md §3](../docs/runtime.md#3-step-1--feature-detection--resume).
  `FEATURE_DIR` resolution and cross-feature enumeration follow the normative
  **Path-Resolution Contract** in [docs/runtime.md §12](../docs/runtime.md#12-path-resolution-contract)
  (parameterized by `storage_strategy`; `flat` is the zero-config default).
- **Pre-flight** — see [docs/runtime.md §4](../docs/runtime.md#4-step-2--pre-flight-check).
- **Sync-verify integration** — see [docs/runtime.md §5](../docs/runtime.md#5-sync-verify-integration).
- **Gate audit trail** — see [docs/runtime.md §6](../docs/runtime.md#6-gate-audit-trail).
- **Dry-run semantics (forward contract)** — see [docs/runtime.md §7](../docs/runtime.md#7-dry-run-semantics).
- **Phase digest requirement** — see [docs/runtime.md §8](../docs/runtime.md#8-phase-digest-requirement-a4).

---

## Intake / Triage (new feature only)

For a **new** feature (no `.forge-status.yml` yet, no `--mode=` override), run an
intake step before fixing the mode (see [docs/policy.md §4.0](../docs/policy.md#40-intake--triage-e15)):

1. Classify the change from `FEATURE_DESCRIPTION` + codebase signals (files/modules
   likely touched, UI present?, schema/contract changes?).
2. Present a structured **`Track`** prompt (see
   [interaction-prompts.md](../docs/templates/interaction-prompts.md)) recommending
   one of `express | lite | standard | v-model`, with the recommended option first.
   When the classification is inconclusive, fall back to the personal
   `default_track_hint` from config (default `"standard"`) as the **pre-selected
   default** in the prompt. The hint is advisory only — a confident classification
   recommendation still wins, and the user can always override.
3. Write the chosen value to **`feature_mode`** (`express | lite | standard |
   v-model`). "Track" is just the user-facing word for the choice at intake; the
   persisted field is `feature_mode` (express is a first-class mode value — see
   [docs/schema.md](../docs/schema.md)). There is no separate `track` field.

Triage may recommend a **downgrade** for a brand-new feature (e.g. `standard → lite`)
— this is distinct from escalation (§"Escalation" below), which only goes upward
once artifacts exist.

### Express mode

When `feature_mode: express`, run only `product-spec` (minimal: one journey +
acceptance criteria) → `plan` (inline) → `implement` → `verify`, then offer
completion. All other phases are `status: "not_applicable"`. Express is append-only
escalatable to lite/standard if the change grows (gains UI, a second module, or a
schema/contract change). See [docs/policy.md §4.1](../docs/policy.md#41-phase-maps).

## Flow Mode (gated vs fluid)

Read `flow_mode` from config (default `gated`):

- **`gated`** — execute phases strictly in order with a gate after each (the
  behavior described throughout this file). When a gate resolves to **Approve**,
  do not auto-advance: emit the structured `Next step` handoff prompt
  (interaction-prompts.md → "Next action at phase handoff": proceed / run optional /
  run cross-cutting / pause) and let the user pick how to continue.
- **`fluid`** — "actions, not phases": after each phase, instead of forcing the
  single next phase, present the **set of currently-runnable phases** (those whose
  dependencies are satisfied) as a structured `Next step` prompt and let the user
  pick. Dependencies are *enablers*, not hard gates. `sync-verify` still runs at
  transitions and gate decisions are still recorded. A phase is "runnable" when its
  required upstream artifacts exist (e.g. `plan` is runnable once `spec.md` exists).

## Headless / CI mode (`--ci`, v1.6, W5-B1)

`forge --ci` runs the lifecycle unattended for automation (CI jobs, scheduled
agents). It is **opt-in** and changes nothing in interactive mode. The hard
guardrail is policy §1.2 / [docs/policy.md §9.3](../docs/policy.md#93-risk-routing-a4--auto-recommend-never-auto-approve):
**`--ci` never auto-approves a human gate.** It only decides, per a declarative
policy, whether a gate may proceed unattended (low-risk + clean deterministic
gate), must stop for a human, or must fail the run.

**Step 0 — load the policy.** Read `.product-forge/gate-policy.yml`
(copy the template at [docs/templates/gate-policy.yml](../docs/templates/gate-policy.yml)
if absent). If the file does not exist, **do not invent a policy** — print
*"`--ci` requires .product-forge/gate-policy.yml (see .specify/extensions/product-forge/docs/templates/gate-policy.yml). Aborting."*
and exit non-zero.

**At each gate** that interactive mode would present to a human, do this instead:

1. **Compute risk** (deterministic, the same classifier the interactive gate uses):

   ```bash
   PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(specify extension path product-forge 2>/dev/null || echo .)}"
   node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/gate-risk.js" --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON `{ risk, signals, reasons, routing }`. Read `risk`
   (`low | medium | high`) from the JSON — `gate-risk.js` exits 0 on success
   regardless of risk (exit 2 only on bad/unreadable input; treat that as `block`).

2. **Look up the action** for `{phase × risk}` in `gate-policy.yml`: use
   `phases.<phase>.<risk>` if the phase is listed, else `defaults.<risk>`. The
   action is one of `auto-recommend | require-human | block`.
   **`release_readiness` and `spec_merge` are always `require-human`** at every
   risk — the policy template hard-pins them, and `--ci` MUST enforce this even
   if a hand-edited policy says otherwise (ship + canonical-spec mutation are human).

3. **Branch on the action:**

   - **`block`** → STOP and fail the run (non-zero exit). Emit the risk reasons.

   - **`require-human`** → STOP without approving. Emit a **reviewable**
     request honoring `safe_outputs` (never the gate decision itself). With the
     default `writes_as: pull_request`:

     ```bash
     gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body-file {FEATURE_DIR}/gate-review.md
     ```

     (or `gh issue create --title "[forge] human gate: {phase}" --body-file {FEATURE_DIR}/gate-review.md`
     when there is no PR). Then exit so a human can approve out-of-band. Do **not**
     write an `approved` gate.

   - **`auto-recommend`** → only permitted after the **deterministic pre-gate**
     passes (`require_clean` in the policy). BOTH checks must hold:

     ```bash
     # (a) structural traceability is clean (exit 0 = pass). Resolve $PLUGIN_ROOT
     #     per .specify/extensions/product-forge/docs/runtime.md §1A; WARN + skip the pre-gate if unreachable.
     node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-traceability.js" --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --strict
     # (b) zero OPEN CRITICAL findings in the unified gate surface.
     # gate-review.md lists findings as bullets, e.g.
     #   - **F-001** · ❌ CRITICAL · `code-review/security` · raised@`{sha}` · ...
     grep -E '^- \*\*F-[0-9]+\*\*.*CRITICAL' {FEATURE_DIR}/gate-review.md \
       | grep -viE '\b(resolved|acknowledged|waived)\b'
     ```

     If `validate-traceability.js --strict` exits non-zero **or** the `grep`
     finds any open CRITICAL row, **downgrade to `require-human`** (emit the
     reviewable request as above) — do **not** auto-recommend. Only when (a)
     exits 0 **and** (b) matches nothing may CI record an `approved` gate
     unattended, stamped per `record_on_auto_recommend`:

     ```yaml
     # appended to gates[] on .forge-status.yml
     - phase: {phase}
       decision: approved
       mode: ci-auto-recommend
       reviewed_sha: {git SHA reviewed}      # §9.2 delta-review carrier
       risk: {risk}                          # from gate-risk.js
       policy_version: 1                     # gate-policy.yml version
       signals: { ... }                      # gate-risk.js signals[]
       validate_traceability: pass           # require_clean evidence
     ```

**Safe-outputs discipline (gh-aw model, `safe_outputs` block).** Honor it on
every headless action: `never_auto_merge: true` (CI may open a PR, **never
merge it**); writes go out only as the reviewable artifact named by `writes_as`
(`pull_request | comment | issue`); request write scope only for that explicit
output (`token_scope: read-only-default`). A human still merges and still owns
every `require-human` phase.

> `--ci` reuses the already-shipped gate surface — it does **not** redesign it:
> the single `gate-review.md` (one `F-NNN` namespace), `gates[].reviewed_sha` /
> `gates[].risk`, `.specify/extensions/product-forge/scripts/gate-risk.js`, `.specify/extensions/product-forge/scripts/validate-traceability.js`, and

> The risk routing semantics are normative in
> [docs/policy.md §9.3](../docs/policy.md#93-risk-routing-a4--auto-recommend-never-auto-approve).

## Preview mode (`--dry-run`, v1.7, P3-A)

`forge --dry-run` (or any single phase with `--dry-run`) runs the lifecycle
fully but mutates **nothing** real: artifacts are written under
`{FEATURE_DIR}/.forge-dry-run/<phase>/`, `.forge-status.yml` is never updated, and
no external side-effects fire (no commit/PR/tracker/skill writes). Each phase emits
a `DRY-RUN-REPORT.md` (would-create / would-modify-with-diff / would-delete + the
status fields that would change), which the orchestrator surfaces in place of the
gate prompt. **The orchestrator MUST propagate `--dry-run` to every delegated
sub-skill.** Full normative contract: [docs/runtime.md §7](../docs/runtime.md#7-dry-run-semantics).
`--dry-run` composes with `--ci` (preview a headless run, record nothing). It also
composes with `--parallel` (implement) and `--cross-model` (code-review) on a
**standalone sub-skill invocation** — e.g. `implement --parallel --dry-run`; the
`forge` orchestrator itself does not forward `--parallel`/`--cross-model` to those
phases (invoke the sub-skill directly to combine them).

## Mode Resolution

Before executing any phase, resolve the feature mode:

1. Read `.forge-status.yml` `feature_mode` field.
2. If absent: use `default_feature_mode` from `.product-forge/config.yml`
   (fallback: `"standard"`).
3. If the user passed `--mode=<value>` in this invocation: override the
   field, write to `.forge-status.yml`, and confirm with the user that
   changing mode mid-feature is intentional.
4. **Validate.** The resolved value MUST be one of
   `"express" | "lite" | "standard" | "v-model"`. If anything else (typo, unknown
   literal, non-string) appears — either in the status file, config
   default, or `--mode=` override — abort immediately with:
   *"Invalid feature_mode: '{value}'. Expected one of express, lite, standard,
   v-model. Fix .forge-status.yml or .product-forge/config.yml and
   re-run."* Do NOT silently fall through to standard. The same
   validation applies to every `phases.<name>.status` read during
   pre-flight — see [docs/runtime.md §4](../docs/runtime.md#4-step-2--pre-flight-check).
5. If resolved mode is `v-model`, run the V-Model detection step
   (see §"V-Model detection" below) before proceeding.

### V-Model detection

V-Model mode requires the external [V-Model Extension Pack](../docs/v-model-integration.md)
(`leocamello/spec-kit-v-model`, ≥0.5.0). It is declared as an optional
extension in this plugin's `extension.yml` but NOT bundled.

Detection:
1. Check whether the command `speckit.v-model.requirements` is available.
2. If present: read its version (from the extension's manifest) and verify `>=0.5.0`.

Behaviour:

| Detection result | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| Present, version OK | Proceed with the v-model phase map below. Read optional `v-model-config.yml` (domain selection) if it exists. |
| Present, version below required | Abort. Print: *"V-Model plugin version {X} detected; Product Forge needs ≥0.5.0. Upgrade with: `specify extension update v-model`."* |
| Not installed | Abort. Print: *"V-Model mode requires the V-Model Extension Pack. Install with:*<br>`specify extension add v-model --from https://github.com/leocamello/spec-kit-v-model/archive/refs/tags/v0.5.0.zip`<br>*Re-run after install. See .specify/extensions/product-forge/docs/v-model-integration.md."* |

Do NOT fall back to standard mode. Regulated / safety-critical work
must not silently degrade.

Lite mode cannot be escalated to v-model mid-feature — v-model requires
artifacts that lite never produced. If a user requests v-model on a lite
feature, reject and suggest creating a new feature in v-model mode.

| V13 Audit report (`speckit.v-model.audit-report`) | — | — | — | ✅ (gates Phase 9) |

In v-model mode, our Phase 2 (product-spec), Phase 3 (revalidation),
Phase 4 (bridge), and Phase 5 (plan) are replaced by the V-Model
progression V1 → V9 with V10 trace checkpoints between each level pair.
See [docs/v-model-integration.md](../docs/v-model-integration.md) for
the full orchestration contract.

In lite mode, phases marked `—` are set to `status: "not_applicable"` on
`.forge-status.yml`. They do NOT receive `gates[]` entries and do NOT
require skip reasons — they were never in scope for this feature. See
[docs/policy.md §3](../docs/policy.md#3-skip-reason-policy-e2).

**Conditional phases** (i18n-harvest, migration-plan, experiment-design)
are skipped automatically without gates when their trigger condition is
not met. They move to `status: "not_applicable"`, not `skipped`, so no
reason is required.

### Escalation from lite to standard

During a lite run, watch for escalation triggers:

- `task_log[].size` contains `L` or `XL`.
- `len(tasks) > 10`.
- `plan.md` references more than 3 modules.

When triggered, prompt the user: *"This feature is exceeding lite-mode
bounds ({trigger reason}). Escalate to standard mode?"* If the user
accepts, set `feature_mode: standard`, keep all existing artifacts, and
run the missing standard-mode phases on the next loop.

Escalation is append-only. Never delete artifacts.

## Status Schema

The `.forge-status.yml` shape is documented in [docs/schema.md](../docs/schema.md)
with the canonical reference in

## Phase 6: Implement

**Test-first Red gate (before delegating).** Tasks marked `Test-first: true` in
tasks.md must fail before any implementation runs. Before handing off:
1. Have `implement` run the `Test-first: true` test tasks and report the result by
   that field name; verify the listed `TC-*` tests are currently **failing**.
2. Record the outcome in `phases.implement.red_gate { status, tests: [TC-*],
   skip_reason }` on `.forge-status.yml`, where `status` is one of
   `confirmed_failing | skipped`.
3. **Do not advance** unless `status: confirmed_failing`, OR the user explicitly
   skips via the structured skip-reason prompt (see
   [interaction-prompts.md](../docs/templates/interaction-prompts.md) → "Skip reason")
   — record `status: skipped` with the captured `skip_reason`. An unconfirmed,
   un-skipped Red gate blocks implementation.

**Delegate to:** `speckit.product-forge.implement`

Acknowledge (recommended) → record as [approved] and continue to Test Plan · 2. Revise — fix CRITICALs and re-run verify [revised] · 3. Skip the next optional phase [skipped] · 4. Rollback to an earlier phase [rolled_back, set rolled_back_to] · 5. Abort [aborted] · (or type your own answer)` — an acknowledgement maps to the `approved` literal. (verify-full itself is read-only and does not write row status.)
- Record gate decision

Update `.forge-status.yml`: `verify.status = completed`.

---

## Phase 8A: Test Plan *(Optional)*

After Phase 7 completes, ask:

```
✅ Verification passed!
